                <h5>The Story Behind UFinder</h5>
                <p> UFinder was founded in September 2021, by a group of University students. The four of them shared a common interest in programming,
                and used to spend their wasted time on Reddit and Quora. As the opening date for University enrolment approached, they noticed that
                thousands of teenagers were seeking for help on these forums, on what would be the most suitable University for each of their situations.
                The University students found interesting the fact that these questions were essentially turned towards tuition fees, entry requirements,
                and ranking. Since most of these answers take their source directly on the institutions' websites, the University students decided to create a tool
                that would extract relevant information from the Internet to use it as a direct answer to the high school students' questions. After slight
                changes in the idea over time, this tool became UFinder, the application that allows students to find the Universities that match the most
                with their profile and ambitions. </p>
                <h10>Behind the scenes</h10>
                <p> In order to build the application, as well as the website to promote it, each member of the team has been assigned some tasks. For instance,
                    while Lina had to edit the presentation video on Sony Vegas, Xavier, Maaz and Adam were coding different parts of the website, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                    The work was coordinated and shared on GitHub. Weekly meetings on Microsoft Teams allowed the students to suggest modifications,
                    to add features, and to help each other if needed. </p>
